# 🌍 Disaster Preparedness and Response Education System (DPRES) — Prototype 2.0

DPRES 2.0 is a comprehensive disaster preparedness and response education platform designed to strengthen resilience through technology, awareness, and collaboration. This repository showcases the working prototype of the system — an early version that visualizes how the platform's modules and functionalities will integrate in real-world applications.

⸻

## 🧭 Project Overview

The Disaster Preparedness and Response Education System (DPRES) aims to bridge the gap between education, emergency management, and technology.
It enables students, institutions, and responders to access vital tools for disaster readiness — including real-time alerts, training modules, incident tracking, and resource coordination — all in one unified platform.

DPRES focuses on awareness through experience, offering digital tools to make learning about disaster preparedness more interactive, data-driven, and accessible.

⸻

## 🎯 Prototype Objective

This prototype serves as a visual and functional demonstration of the final platform's vision.
It highlights the intended user interface, workflow, and interactivity, giving stakeholders and evaluators a clear idea of how DPRES will operate once fully developed.
