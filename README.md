# 🌍 Disaster Preparedness and Response Education System (DPRES) — Prototype 2.0

DPRES 2.0 is a comprehensive disaster preparedness and response education platform designed to strengthen resilience through technology, awareness, and collaboration. This repository showcases the working prototype of the system — an early version that visualizes how the platform's modules and functionalities will integrate in real-world applications.



## 🧭 Project Overview

The Disaster Preparedness and Response Education System (DPRES) aims to bridge the gap between education, emergency management, and technology.
It enables students, institutions, and responders to access vital tools for disaster readiness — including real-time alerts, training modules, incident tracking, and resource coordination — all in one unified platform.

DPRES focuses on awareness through experience, offering digital tools to make learning about disaster preparedness more interactive, data-driven, and accessible.



## 🎯 Prototype Objective

This prototype serves as a visual and functional demonstration of the final platform's vision.
It highlights the intended user interface, workflow, and interactivity, giving stakeholders and evaluators a clear idea of how DPRES will operate once fully developed.



## ⚙️ Key Features (Demonstrated in the Prototype)
- 🗺️ **Interactive Map Interface** — Displays disaster incidents, affected areas, and nearby resources.
- 🚨 **Emergency SOS & Alerts** — Quick emergency notifications for individuals and institutions.
- 🎓 **Training & Simulation Modules** — Virtual reality and digital learning modules for preparedness education.
- 📊 **Incident Reporting & Analytics Dashboard** — Collect, visualize, and analyze incident data.
- 🔐 **Role-Based Access & Authentication** — User roles for students, teachers, and admins.
- 💬 **Communication Tools** — Alerts, notices, and real-time coordination during emergencies.

## 🧩 Notes
- This is a prototype build, not a complete or deployable version.
- The UI, architecture, and functionalities are subject to refinement as feedback and testing progress.
- All visuals are internally developed assets; any resemblance to third-party material is coincidental.



## 💡 Vision

DPRES envisions a future where education and emergency response work hand-in-hand — empowering communities to react faster, respond smarter, and recover stronger.
By combining data, design, and digital education, DPRES aims to make disaster preparedness a culture, not just a curriculum.
