## 🎭 Test Patterns & Best Practices

### 1. **Component Rendering**
```typescript
render(
  <LanguageProvider>
    <AlertProvider>
      <Component {...props} />
    </AlertProvider>
  </LanguageProvider>
);
```

### 2. **Mock Functions**
```typescript
const mockOnLogin = vi.fn();
const mockOnLogout = vi.fn();
```

### 3. **Async Testing**
```typescript
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByTestId('element')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 4. **Multiple Elements**
```typescript
expect(screen.getAllByText(/text/i).length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
```
